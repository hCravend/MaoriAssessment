# Maori Quiz Software

## Overview
This is a console-based quiz application in C# which quizzes the user on Maori culture, a significant indigenous culture of New Zealand. The quiz covers various aspects such as language, history, and customs. It has three difficulty levels - easy, medium, and hard. Each level consists of five multiple choice questions, with four possible answers (A-D) for each question.

## How It Works
1. Upon starting the application, the user is greeted and asked to enter their name.
2. After entering their name, the user is presented with three difficulty options: easy, medium, and hard.
3. After selecting a difficulty, the user is shown instructions for the quiz and asked to press any key to proceed.
4. The user is then asked a series of five multiple-choice questions. After each question, the user's score is updated. For each correct answer, the user receives two points.
5. The user's total score is displayed at the end of the quiz. To pass the quiz, the user must score at least eight points out of ten.
6. After the quiz ends, the user is asked if they want to take the quiz again.
