The game displays the player's score and the number of questions remaining after each question. The game loops through each question using a for loop with an iteration of 1.

             Each question is an element in an array of strings, with the answer choices presented to the player using a switch statement. The code also includes validation for invalid input, requiring the player to select a valid answer. */
