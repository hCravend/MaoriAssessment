              The quiz consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, with each correct answer adding one point to the player's score. The game displays the player's score and the number of questions remaining after each question. The game loops through each question using a for loop with an iteration of 1.

             Each question is an element in an array of strings, with the answer choices presented to the player using a switch statement. The code also includes validation for invalid input, requiring the player to select a valid answer. */
